    NieR: Automata tells the story of androids 2B, 9S and A2 and their battle to reclaim the machine-driven dystopia overrun by powerful machines.
    <br><br>
    Humanity has been driven from the Earth by mechanical beings from another world. In a final effort to take back the planet, the human resistance sends a force of android soldiers to destroy the invaders. Now, a war between machines and androids rages on... A war that could soon unveil a long-forgotten truth of the world.
    <br><br>
    Key Features:
    <br>
    <ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Action-Packed Battles</strong> 
    â Players will switch between using melee and ranged attacks in battle against hordes of enemies and challenging bosses across a variety of open field maps. The tight controls and incredibly fluid combat are simple to learn for newcomers while offering plenty of depth for more experienced action gamers. Players can perform high-speed battle actionsâcombining light and heavy attacksâand switch through an arsenal of weaponry while evading enemies with speed and style. 
    <br></li>
    <li>
    <strong>Beautifully Desolate Open-World</strong> 
    â The game seamlessly joins together hauntingly beautiful vistas and locations with no area loading. The environments are rendered in 60fps and contain a wealth of sub-events in addition to the main storyline. 
    <br></li>
    <li>
    <strong>Masterfully Crafted Story and Characters</strong> 
    â NieR: Automata tells the story of androids 2B, 9S and A2 and their ferocious battle to reclaim a machine-driven dystopia overrun by powerful weapons known as machine lifeforms.
    <br></li>
    <li>
    <strong>Elements of an RPG</strong> 
    â Players will obtain a variety of weapon types, level up in battle, learn new combat skills, and customise a loadout that caters to their playstyle.
    <br></li>
    <li>
    <strong>Utilise the Pod Support System to Assist In and Outside of Battle</strong> 
    â Pods can attack the enemy in both manual and lock-on modes. They can also assist outside of battle, such as allowing the player to glide through the air. Pods can be enhanced throughout the game, with upgrades including new attack methods and variations.
    <br></li>
    <li>
    <strong>âAuto Modeâ Available for Beginners </strong>
    â Novice players can elect âAuto Modeâ for easy attacks and evasions.

    about: `Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreamsâ¦ as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up â not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaitsâ¦ step through the looking-glass and join it!
    <br><br><br>
    <strong>FEATURES</strong>
    <br><br>
    ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (âLumenâ), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (âNaniteâ) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.
    <br><br><br>
    Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.
    <br><br><br>
    ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARKâs worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island is released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.
    <br><br><br>
    The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed &amp; ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. 
    <br><br><br>
    Thorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.
    <br><br><br>
    Cross-Platform Modding: Download &amp; play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated new Mod-bowser directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!
    <br><br><br>
    Cross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!
    <br><br><br>
    Supports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players.`,
